				<span class="bold white">Risk</span> 一 my intolerance for it disrupted my first foray into programming about six 
				years ago when I took my first computer science class after hearing about its 
				infamous difficulty from friends. I remember pulling my first all-nighter to finish 
				a project. That night, my endless frustration transformed into reward as I pieced 
				together logic that previously seemed incomprehensible. I recall these late-night 
				hours paying dividends when I finally watched my snake program smoothly slide through 
				the screen, eating randomized dots along the grid and turning effortlessly on my 
				command. Though I had genuinely enjoyed this course as it flexed a different part of 
				my brain, I was ultimately afraid of possibly diluting my image of being an A 
				student. The thought of “what if” has endlessly plagued me because my interest in 
				coding did not subside. Rather it stayed kindled in my mind as I dabbled in online 
				programming and analytics courses. At work, I willed myself to weave in coding, and 
				I found myself gravitating towards VS Code instead of Excel, spending time post-work 
				on debugging the Python script that I had written. Today, that budding interest has 
				blossomed, and my greatest motivation is to prove to myself that I can succeed not 
				only in learning how to program, but also in challenging my perpetual intolerance for risk.
				<br>
				<br>
				Today, I'm learning to become a <span class="white">software developer</span> because I am a hard worker, problem solver, 
				analytical thinker, and creative at heart. I'm excited to this next path in my professional 
				journey, to see what I can develop and how I can grow to become a more resilient, curious, 
				intentional person. Outside of budding interesting for coding, I'm an avid coffee drinker, skincare 
				and makeup enthusiast, and reality TV connoisseur. Have you seen the latest season of Love is Blind?
